        <h1>Passions & Interests</h1>
        <p>Hobbies are what keep life interesting. 
            Whether it's listening to music, gaming, or diving into a good book,
             I love exploring new ways to unwind and be creative. 
            Here, you’ll find what I enjoy most in my free time</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="hob-col">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Music has the power to uplift and energize. Whether you're listening to
                     your favorite playlist, exploring new genres, or attending live performances,
                     music offers an emotional connection that can be deeply personal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hob-col">
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>I love gaming, especially those that let me dive into fantasy worlds or challenge
                     my strategic thinking. Whether it’s playing a competitive multiplayer game or a
                      single-player RPG, gaming is my way of unwinding and having fun with friends.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hob-col">
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>Reading has been one of my favorite pastimes for as long as I can remember. 
                    From gripping novels to interesting short stories, I love escaping into different
                     worlds through books. Whether it’s fiction or non-fiction, there’s always
                      something new to discover.</p>

<!-- PERSONAL INFO -->
<section class="personalInfo">
    <h1>A Glimpse Into My Life</h1>
    <p>I’m passionate about saving money and staying organized. I’m curious by nature, always learning new things,
         and I enjoy being creative while keeping a practical outlook on life.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="perInfo">
            <h3> Like saving money</h3>
            <img src="images/Save money.jpg"
            <p>I’ve always been someone who prefers to save rather than spend.
                 Whether it’s for big goals like travel or just having a rainy-day fund,
                 I like knowing I’ve got something tucked away for the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="perInfo">
            <h3> Favorite Food</h3>
            <p>When it comes to food, I’m all about variety. But if I had to choose,
                 I’d say I have a soft spot for anything savory—especially dishes that bring comfort, like pizza or pasta.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="perInfo">
            <h3> Daily Habits</h3>
            <p>I start my day with a cup of coffee and a bit of quiet time before diving into my tasks. 
                It’s a habit that helps me stay focused and sets the tone for the rest of the day</p>

    <h1>Life in Motion: My Everyday Activities</h1>
    <p>I love spending weekends exploring new places and trying new things. 
        My daily routines keep me active and make life exciting.</p>

            <img src="images/cup.jpg"
            <p>My daily routine plays a big role in shaping my day. I usually start 
                with a cup of coffee to wake up, followed by a bit of exercise to energize myself for the day ahead. 
                Then, I dive into work or school tasks, staying productive with a clear plan in mind.</p>

            <h3>Helping Out and Gaining Experience</h3>
            <img src="images/shop.jpg"
            <p>Every week, I step in to help out by selling goods at my neighbor’s house
                 in place of my mom. It’s a routine I’ve come to enjoy as it not only allows 
                 me to lend a hand but also gives me valuable experience in managing sales,
                  interacting with customers, and keeping track of inventory.</p>
